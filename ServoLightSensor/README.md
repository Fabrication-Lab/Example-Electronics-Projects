## 3. Import an fSpy project file

Once the add-on is installed and activated, fSpy project files can be imported by selecting _fSpy_ from the _Import_ menu. This will create a camera with the same name as the imported project file.

__Update existing import (if any)__ - If checked, any previously created camera with a name matching the project filename will be updated. If unchecked, a new camera will be created on each import. 

__Import background image__ - If checked, the image from the fSpy project file will be used as the background image for the Blender camera.
