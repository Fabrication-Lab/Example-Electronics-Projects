## Importing Fritzing Parts
<font size="2"> For the Fritzing Software we have some parts that are not available in the default fritzing library

In this tutorial we will be showing you how to import parts into the fritzing software. 
<u>
 <li> 1. Opening the Software</li>
 <li> 2. Go over to the MINE TAB </li>
</ul> 
</font>

## 1. Opening the software
<font size="2"> Firstly open the fritzing software and look over to the window on the right with the subheading of parts </font>

## 2. Go over to the MINE tab
<font size="2"> This MINE tab is a "bin" that will show your individual imported parts that you have made, but if you import a bin, you would ned to scroll down to the tab of the bin. This will be shown later in the tutorial. </font>

## 3. Import
<font size="2"> You will have to import the part now, to do this you **right click** in the empty space </font>

<font size="2"> Then on the drop down menu click on import </font>

## 4. Import the wanted Part or Bin
<font size="2">In the file window click on the wanted file or bin that you need.</font>

<font size="1">_Note: that you cannot select multiple items at once, you will_</font>

## 5. Use the part
You can now use the imported parts.

For individual Imported Parts you can go over to the mine tab and find them there.

But for bins you will find them in a seperate tab, you will likely have to scroll down to the bottom of the tab and find the bin.

_This is an example using the DFRobot Fritzing Library_
